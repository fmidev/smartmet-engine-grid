# This file is used in order to find metric height positions for grid points when the original
# level information is not metric. For example, the orginal levels might be expressed in pressure
# levels or hybrid levels, and we need to define how to find out matching metric levels. Notice
# that each point of pressure/hybrid level might have different metric height. The basic idea
# is that there should be a grid that defines these metric heights directly of indirectly by
# using a multiplier. 

# On the other hand, it is possible that the grid that contains the metric heights of the given 
# level is found from different producer. In this case the producers should have the same analysis 
# times in their generations, same timesteps and the same levels so that the matching height definitions 
# can be found.
#  
# Fields:
#   1) Producer that uses this mappping 
#   2) Level type that uses this mapping
#       2 Pressure level
#       3 Hybrid level
#   3) Producer that has the required height information  
#   4) Parameter that contains the required height information
#   5) Value of the height parameter needs to be multiplied by this value in order to get the metric value
