# that is optimized for fetching content information. The usage of the cache requires
# quite much memory, which means that it would be smarter to use shared (=remote) cache when
# possible. On the other hand, the remote content server is usually always up and running
# which means that it can be used immediately. If the content cache is local then it
# takes some time to start the system and make sure that the cache is up to data.
